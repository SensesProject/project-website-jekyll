        <li><strong>The Netherlands</strong><br />To inform regional decision makers on local implications of global change is the foremost goal of this local case study. Scenario information on different scales will be elaborated to support the land recultivation project of “De Overijsselse Vecht” in the Netherlands to a semi-natural lowland river system.</li>
        <li><strong>East Africa / Kenya</strong><br /> This case study will address the need for enhancing the capacity to assessing, interpreting and building integrated scenarios in the context of the many interlinked challenges East Africa is facing due to climate change. All of these challenges – e.g. food and energy security and health – are tightly linked to the socioeconomic development like population growth and economic development.</li>
