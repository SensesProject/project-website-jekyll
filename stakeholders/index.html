        National and international climate policy makers need scenario input to strategic climate policy discussions, e.g., concerning the policy implementation and global implications of national contributions under the Paris Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Businesses, particularly those with long-term planning horizon such as energy and transport companies, need information through scenarios about climate policy developments and climate change projections to explore their investment opportunities and risks.
      </p>
      <p>
      The use of scenario analysis in disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities has moved into focus since the start of the <a href="https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/"> TCFD </a> (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 2017) initiative. 
SENSES actively supports stakeholders of this initiative.

        Regional climate change scenario users such as regional governments, water boards, NGOs, farmer organization etc., seek information about local implications of global socio-economic change, climate change and climate policies. Such scenarios can be used to explore inter-linkages with other sustainable development goals, e.g. relating to food, water and energy availability and poverty. Our regional case studies will focus on

      <ul>
        <li><p><strong>The Netherlands</strong><br />To inform regional decision makers on local implications of global change is the foremost goal of this local case study. Scenario information on different scales will be elaborated to support the land recultivation project of “De Overijsselse Vecht” in the Netherlands to a semi-natural lowland river system.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>East Africa / Kenya</strong><br /> This case study will address the need for enhancing the capacity to assessing, interpreting and building integrated scenarios in the context of the many interlinked challenges East Africa is facing due to climate change. All of these challenges – e.g. food and energy security and health – are tightly linked to the socioeconomic development like population growth and economic development.</p></li>
