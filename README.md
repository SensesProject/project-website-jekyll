# Senses Project Website

The Senses project investigates potential socioeconomic futures in the face of climate change and how this knowledge can be made accessible to a broader public.

SENSES will develop tools and approaches to make the new generation of climate change scenarios more comprehensible and accessible. Further information can be found on the project website: [senses-project.org](http://senses-project.org/)
