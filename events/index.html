        The kick off meeting was already a great success. The consortium and the stakeholders were introduced and the scope of the project clarified. 
        The kick-off also had a focus on visualization, as communication and the visual depiction of scenario knowledge are in the center of SENSES. 
Another building block of the first meeting was the identification of indicators that allow the connection of the stakeholder language to the scientific data.
