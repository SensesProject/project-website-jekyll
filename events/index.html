      <h4>Kick-off meeting with global stakeholders, 2017</h4>
      <h5>October 18th, 2017 – PIK, Potsdam, Germany</h5>

      <p>
        The kick off meeting took place in Potsdam at PIK (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research).
        The consortium and the stakeholders were introduced and the scope of the project clarified.
        The kick-off also had a focus on visualization, as communication and the visual depiction of scenario knowledge are in the center of SENSES.
        Another building block of the first meeting was the identification of indicators that allow the connection of the stakeholder language to the scientific data.

      <h4>Co-production workshop with global stakeholders, 2018</h4>
      <h5>May 30th-31st, 2018 – PIK, Potsdam, Germany</h5>

        In this workshop, scenario users co‐created capacities to find, use and interpret scenarios together with scenario experts. The workshop had a high interaction rate. Accordingly, all sessions were either direct co-production units where stakeholders produced first results together with domain experts or the sessions consisted of intermediate project- results presented by the consortium (developed since the kick-off meeting, Oct 2017).<br />
        A joint progress on methodologies and tools was made to empower stakeholders to extract valuable information contained in scenario results and to answer their questions.

      <h4>Co-production workshop with global stakeholders, 2019</h4>
      <h5>May 21st-22nd, 2019 – SEI, Stockholm, Sweden</h5>

        In this workshop, scenario users were presented a range of communication modules (under development) and asked for their feedback. 
       Together the existing modules were further co-developed and shaped. 
    Novice users established the contextual basis on which knowledge transfer for the financial community can take place. 
      Advanced users co-designed novel communication elements for more in depth exploration (guided explore modules). Central reference parameters and the level of potential complexity were identified.

      <h4>Co-production workshop with regional stakeholders, 2019</h4>
      <h5>September 21st-22nd, 2019 – Nairobi, Kenya</h5>

        The SENSES case study in Kenya is focused on understanding the country's vulnerability to future transnational climate risks using a scenario-based analysis framework. The multiscale scenario design is applied to develop future socioeconomic scenarios for Kenya, which are linked to the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) and relevant to the local and regional context and characteristics. 
        The first workshop in this case study was focused on building the skeletons of future socioeconomic scenarios for Kenya. In this workshop, stakeholders first identified the most important drivers for understanding Kenya’s vulnerability to future transnational climate risks in a participatory process. Then, the SSPs were introduced as the top-down boundary conditions, and stakeholders co-produced alternative states (conditions) for the identified drivers given the context described in each SSP. By combining alternative states of drivers given the alternative SSPs, stakeholders co-produced the skeletons of future socioeconomic scenarios for Kenya.
