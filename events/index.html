      <h4>Kick-off meeting</h4>
      <h5>October 18th, 2017 – PIK, Potsdam, Germany</h5>

        The kick off meeting took place in Potsdam at PIK (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research).
        The consortium and the stakeholders were introduced and the scope of the project clarified.
        The kick-off also had a focus on visualization, as communication and the visual depiction of scenario knowledge are in the center of SENSES.
        Another building block of the first meeting was the identification of indicators that allow the connection of the stakeholder language to the scientific data.

      <h4>Second meeting</h4>
      <h5>May 30th-31st, 2018 – PIK, Potsdam, Germany</h5>

        In this workshop, scenario users co‐created capacities to find, use and interpret scenarios together with scenario experts. The workshop had a high interaction rate. Accordingly, all sessions were either direct co-production units where stakeholders produced first results together with domain experts or the sessions consisted of intermediate project- results presented by the consortium (developed since the kick-off meeting, Oct 2017).<br />
        A joint progress on methodologies and tools was made to empower stakeholders to extract valuable information contained in scenario results and to answer their questions.

        In this workshop, scenario users were presented a range of communication modules (under development) and asked for their feedback. 
       Together the existing modules were further co-developed and shaped. 
    Novice users established the contextual basis on which knowledge transfer for the financial community can take place. 
      Advanced users co-designed novel communication elements for more in depth exploration (guided explore modules). Central reference parameters and the level of potential complexity were identified.
