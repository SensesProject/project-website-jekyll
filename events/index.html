      <h4>Co-production workshop with global and local stakeholders, 2020</h4>
      <span class="location">March 04–05, 2020 – University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Germany</span>

      The focus of the workshop was on the advancement of the toolkit and user specific portals, getting feedback from stakeholders and to identify gaps in the choice of information.
      Feedback was collected in a one-to-one evaluation, where users had to conduct a quiz in order to directly examine the effectiveness of the communication products developed within SENSES.
      The feedback was very positive and foremost the stakeholders see great potential in the SENSES approach of user empowerment and staged access to the content for varying background knowledge.
      Another highlight was the co-production of regional extensions for the finance sector on global socio economic scenarios.

      <h4>Co-production workshop with regional stakeholders, 2019</h4>

        In the second SENSES workshop in Kenya, regional stakeholders were presented four socioeconomic scenarios for Kenya and projections of population and GDP for each scenario. A set of four artistic paintings were used in the workshop’s setting to better communicate the qualitative storylines to stakeholders. After discussing the usefulness and relevance of the scenario set, stakeholders were asked to identify future Transnational Climate Risks given the context described in each alternative scenario for the future of Kenya, and co-produce adaptation options addressing the identified cross-border risks. The main objective of this workshop was to use a multiscale scenario set to explore future cross-border climate risks and co-produce adaptation options which can further be framed as complementary recommendations to improve the adaptation architecture of Kenya.

      <h4>Co-production workshop with regional stakeholders, 2019</h4>

        The SENSES case study in Kenya is focused on understanding the country's vulnerability to future transnational climate risks using a scenario-based analysis framework. The multiscale scenario design is applied to develop future socioeconomic scenarios for Kenya, which are linked to the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) and relevant to the local and regional context and characteristics.
        The first workshop in this case study was focused on building the skeletons of future socioeconomic scenarios for Kenya. In this workshop, stakeholders first identified the most important drivers for understanding Kenya’s vulnerability to future transnational climate risks in a participatory process. Then, the SSPs were introduced as the top-down boundary conditions, and stakeholders co-produced alternative states (conditions) for the identified drivers given the context described in each SSP. By combining alternative states of drivers given the alternative SSPs, stakeholders co-produced the skeletons of future socioeconomic scenarios for Kenya.

        In this workshop, scenario users were presented a range of communication modules (under development) and asked for their feedback.
       Together the existing modules were further co-developed and shaped.
    Novice users established the contextual basis on which knowledge transfer for the financial community can take place.
      Advanced users co-designed novel communication elements for more in depth exploration (guided explore modules). Central reference parameters and the level of potential complexity were identified.

        In this workshop, scenario users co‐created capacities to find, use and interpret scenarios together with scenario experts. The workshop had a high interaction rate. Accordingly, all sessions were either direct co-production units where stakeholders produced first results together with domain experts or the sessions consisted of intermediate project- results presented by the consortium (developed since the kick-off meeting, Oct 2017).<br />
        A joint progress on methodologies and tools was made to empower stakeholders to extract valuable information contained in scenario results and to answer their questions.

      <h4>Kick-off meeting with global stakeholders, 2017</h4>
      <span class="location">October 18th, 2017 – PIK, Potsdam, Germany</span>

        The kick off meeting took place in Potsdam at PIK (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research).
        The consortium and the stakeholders were introduced and the scope of the project clarified.
        The kick-off also had a focus on visualization, as communication and the visual depiction of scenario knowledge are in the center of SENSES.
        Another building block of the first meeting was the identification of indicators that allow the connection of the stakeholder language to the scientific data.
