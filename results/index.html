        The first tool is our interactive primer that helps you understand what climate change scenarios are and how they are connected to socioeconomics, energy & land use, emissions, climate and climate impacts. We explain the basic terminology to get you started with our visualisation tools.

      <p>
        To allow easier access to the new generation of climate change scenarios SENSES provides factsheets for each study that answer in a short, concise manner the essential of each study. They summarize like a setcard the guiding questions, central results and further products from these studies.

      <h4>Co-production techniques database</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        A comprehensive overview of co-production techniques in the context of climate change scenarios. 
        The various methods are specified by characteristics like the project goal, the type of scenario knowledge generation, but also very practical attributes like duration or degree of engagement.   
        This supports a pick and choose approach of the appropriate method for co-production events with external stakeholders.
