        <h4>Modeling climate through scenarios</h4>
        <p>
          Climate change is a multi-scale and long-term problem. Therefore, the integrated assessment of climate change response measures requires information on how climate and societies around. the <a href="#">world will interact</a> long into the future. To this end, global scenarios of socio-economic and climate change futures have been used since the 90ies (Legett et al., 1992) to <i>inform climate policy makers</i>. Such integrated scenarios are indispensable to assess the impact of climate change on societies, the means to adapt to future climate change, and the ways to mitigate climate change in line with long-term climate protection targets.
